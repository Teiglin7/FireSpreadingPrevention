            The fire just started in a forest.
            It will spread and destroy all its environment composed of three types of cells:
            <ul>
                <li>valuable cells, represented with houses</li>
                <li>less valuable cells, represented with trees</li>
                <li>safe cells, represented with a beige ground</li>
            </ul>
			You have the ability to make cell safe in order to block the spreading of the fire.
            This action will be called "cutting"  (for the trees, but may also be made on houses).
            It will enable you to prevent some cells from burning.
            However this action takes time and the fire doesn't wait for you.
            You will have to choose carefully which cells to cut in order to protect as much value as you can before the fire reaches these cells.

            <span>Rules</span>
        </h1>
        <div>
            <div class="statement-rules-content">
            	A cell is either a safe cell or a tree cell or a house cell.
            	All tree and house cells have three parameters:
	            <ul>
	                <li><var>fireDuration</var>: number of turns a cell remains on fire before propagating into the adjacent cells.</li>
	                <li><var>cutDuration</var>: number of turns needed to make the cell safe.</li>
	                <li><var>value</var>: score represented by this cell and lost if this cell is burnt or cut.</li>
	            </ul>
	            These three parameters are the same for each "tree" cells and the same for each "house" cells.
	            You are given these parameters (6 values), the size of the map, the starting cell of the fire, and finally the type of each cell of the map.
	            By blocking the spreading fire, you must save as much value as you can.<br>
	            
				A cell in fire stays in fire during <var>fireDuration</var> turns.
                Each cell has a <var>fireProgress</var> incremented each turns.
                Once this <var>fireProgress</var> reaches <var>fireDuration</var>, the tile is considered as burnt and propagates into the four adjacent cells (North, South, East, West) if they are not safe and not burnt (with <var>fireProgress</var> == <const>-1</const>).
                <br>
				You can cut cells to make them safe and block the spreading of the fire. When you cut a cell, a <var>cooldown</var> is set to the <var>cutDuration</var> of the cell. It will decrease during the next turns until it reaches 0. While the <var>cooldown</var> is non zero, you may not give another cell to cut.
                <br>
                You cannot cut cells which are safe (it would be useless) and cells which are on fire (or you will burn with the cell). Otherwise the game will end. Also, a cell is considered safe as soon as you start to cut it. That is, a fire in an adjacent cell cannot spread into the cell where you already are.
                <br>
                <strong>Note</strong>: If a game is ended because of a timeout or a bad output, you don't necessarily lose. The game will compute the spreading of the remaining fire if any, then the success of the test will be determined by comparing the lost value with the given maximal lost value.

        I didn't provide any validator yet, since the tests may change. Hence you can suggest some ideas of test if you think some scenarios have to be tested.
